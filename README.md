# Second-hand-cars-price-Prediction
 The price of the secondhand cars is not fixed and a person with no prior knowledge of cars can be cheated easily by the dealers by quoting higher prices. • I have to deploy a web page as a service which incorporates all the features of all used cars to predict the price of a car • Since it is a regression problem, I have used k-fold cross validation method and looped in with some of the regression algorithms and found the best model based on their model scores. • The best model obtained is XGB • By using randomized search cv method I found the best estimator and by using those estimators my model gives train accuracy of 98.29% and test accuracy of 82.31% • MSE – 23.41 • RMSE – 4.83 • Finally, I have deployed a web page using streamlit as a service which incorporates all the features of all used cars to predict the price of a car.
